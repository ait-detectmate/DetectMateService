We're happily taking patches and other contributions. Below is a summary of the processes we follow for any contribution.

## Bug reports and enhancement requests

Bug reports and enhancement requests are an important part of making `DetectMateService` more stable and are curated through Github issues.
Before reporting an issue, check our backlog of open issues to see if anybody else has already reported it. 
If that is the case, you might be able to give additional information on that issue.
Bug reports are very helpful to us in improving the software, and therefore, they are very welcome. It is very important to give us
at least the following information in a bug report:

1. Description of the bug. Describe the problem clearly.
2. Steps to reproduce. With the following configuration, go to.., click.., see error
3. Expected behavoir. What should happen?
4. Environment. What was the environment for the test(version, browser, etc..)

![GitHub Workflow]( images/GitHub-Contrib.drawio.png)

### 1. Fork

Go to [https://github.com/ait-detectmate/DetectMateService.git](https://github.com/ait-detectmate/DetectMateService.git) and click on fork. Please note that you must login first to GitHub.

### 2. Clone

After forking the repository into your own workspace, clone the development branch of that repository.

```bash
git clone -b development git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/DetectMateService.git
```

### 3. Create a feature branch

Every single workpackage should be developed in it's own feature-branch. Use a name that describes the feature:

```bash
cd DetectMateService
git checkout -b feature-some_important_work
```

### 4. Develop your feature and improvements in the feature-branch

Please make sure that you commit only improvements that are related to the workpage you created the feature-branch for. See the section [Development](development.md) for detailed information about how to develope code for `DetectMateService`. 

*`DetectMateService` uses [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek) to ensure code quality. Make sure that you use it properly*

### 5. Fetch and merge from the upstream

If your work on this feature-branch is done, make sure that you are in sync with the branch of the upstream:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:ait-detectmate/DetectMateService.git
git pull upstream development
```

If any conflicts occur, fix them and add them using `git add` and continue with the merge or fast-forward.

### 6. Push the changes to your GitHub-repository

Before we can push our changes, we have to make sure that we don't have unnecessary commits. First checkout our commits:

```bash
git log
```

After that we can squash the last n commits together:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~n
```

Finally you can push the changes to YOUR github-repository:

```bash
git push
```

### 7. Submit your pull-request

Use the GitHub-Webinterface to create a pull-request. Make sure that the target-repository is `ait-detectmate/DetectMateService`.

If your pull-request was accepted and merged into the development branch continue with "8. Update your local development branch". If it wasn't accepted, read the comments and fix the problems. Before pushing the changes make sure that you squashed them with your last commit:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~2
```

Delete your local feature-branch after the pull-request was merged into the development branch.

### 8. Update your local main branch

Update your local development branch:

```bash
git fetch upstream development
git checkout -b development
git rebase upstream/development
```

### 9. Update your main branch in your github-repository

Please make sure that you updated your local development branch as described in section 8. above. After that push the changes to your github-repository to keep it up2date:

```bash
git push
```
